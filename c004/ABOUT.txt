This is channel 004 with Re = 180 in the mesh generation settings
The values of UT are found using kriging

restartPREPRO.in has no values for any variables, it's just the 
periodic mesh from prepro

restartUT.out is the result of running ifDualKrig for 1 timestep
and has only the values of UT set in the restart file

you will need to run ifDualCV to get the original viscosity
restartCV.out is the result of running ifDualCV, which reads
in nu_t.dat and spits out nut_no.dat

restartRANS.out is the converged ifDualAdj Primal solution
with prescribed turbulent viscosity

restartADJ.out is the converged ifDualAdj Adjoint solution

nut_noRANS.dat is the k-omega turbulent viscosity that is
used to set the bounds for the optimization routine
